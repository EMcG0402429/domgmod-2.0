*==========================*

This is ostensibly a balance mod, but mostly is things I think should
be fixed and have noticed.
If you have a particular thing you think should be addressed, there's a
google doc here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wGpevUd4nflnAh9qlszXVQsLbSxzyasuOhimhAWsW-Q/edit#heading=h.hrdt488j0ae4
Where you can leave a note and I will be able to see it.

The mod itself lives here:
https://github.com/EMcG0402429/domgmod-dom5
All of the releases, such as they are, will be on the Releases page.
If you have spotted a cockup, there's error tracking where you can
report that.
If you think I have fucked up and you can do much better, feel free to
fork it, fix things, and submit pull requests.
