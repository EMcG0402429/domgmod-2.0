*==========================*

This is ostensibly a balance mod, but mostly is things I think should
be fixed and have noticed.
If you have a particular thing you think should be addressed, there's a
google doc here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wGpevUd4nflnAh9qlszXVQsLbSxzyasuOhimhAWsW-Q/edit#heading=h.hrdt488j0ae4
Where you can leave a note and I will be able to see it.

The mod itself lives here:

All of the releases, such as they are, will be on the Releases page.
If you have spotted a cockup, there's error tracking where you can
report that.
If you think I have fucked up and you can do much better, feel free to
fork it, fix things, and submit pull requests.


CHANGELOG
---------
v2.00
-   Cu Sidhe are now capable of barking at people in a seriously spooky
    manner.
-   Living Pillars, following extensive workplace safety training, now
    understand the value of head protection.
-   Crab Generals now come in Crab Soldier flavor, and both flavors 
    recuperate and show up in coastal forts.
-   Cave crabs recuperate as well.
-   Swans still aren't sacred, but at least no longer actively get in
    the way of your attempts to siege things.
-   Morvar'ch riding Ys troops/commanders now get a tail slap and
    boiling breath attack from their mounts, when underwater.
-   Ys cavalry that DON'T ride on murderous fire breathing horses just
    get the tail slap from the mount.
-   Aphroi and Ichthycentaurs get their own version of the tailslap
    (benefiting from str, as they're centaurs) underwater, and a hoof
    attack on land.
-   Aphroi also get an additional attack from their tiny adorable
    sacred claws.
-   EA Machakan War Lions are now sacred, on account of being super
    totemic and generally revered.
-   MA Machakan Black Sorcerors are now sacred, on account of being
    literally descended from god.
-   Scelerian Thaumaturgs have been taking correspondence courses as
    part of an effort to ascend to Grand Thaumaturg, and now have a 50%
    chance to get an extra +1 AWSD.
-   LA Pythium's Revellers are now applying themselves properly to
    their party planning, and have managed to improve their 20%NB to
    100%NB.

    kick things.

-   Breath of The Desert is now F3, rather than F3A1
-   LA Pythium's Serpent Priests have discovered how to lure out Hydra
    with nature gems instead of going through their standard hiring
    process, which unduly restricted Hydra opportunities. (Conj4, N2H2)
-   There's a super innovative new Fire spell at Conj5 that lets you
    boost the entire battlefield's abilities in Fire magic. (Conj5 F3)
-   Machakan research mages have developed a spell for making all their
    animals go very fast. (Ench7 N4)
